# README

This data mining repository is focusing on the coding assignments designed by [Dr Yao-Yi Chiang](https://yaoyichi.github.io/) for module [DSCI553(INF553)](https://web-app.usc.edu/soc/syllabus/20201/32403.pdf). All codes are emphasised on using **Spark** to handle massive data. 

The professor allowed students to post our codes on the GitHub; these codes will be used for plagiarism checking in the future. Therefore, anyone who is currently in this course is strongly discouraged to see the codes.

The repository consists of six parts

* A warm-up for spark
* SON algorithm for Frequent Item
* Recommender System
* Girvan-Newman algorithm for Community Detecting
