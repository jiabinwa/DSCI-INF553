Don't even think they realized we walked in. However everyone at the bar noticed we walked in!!! Service was non existent at best. Not a good way for a new business to start out. Oh well, the location they are at has been about 5 different things over the past several years, so they will just be added to the list. SMDH!!!", "date": "2017-12-15 23:27:08"}

I reached out because I needed help planning my soon to be sister in law's bachelorette. It was a group of 10 girls so I was a little overwhelmed but Michael saved the day! Everything was super smooth and easy! We got good deals and had the best time ever! We booked hotel and a bachelorette package for a great price. I have saved contact info because I will for sure reach out again on next Vegas trip!!!", "date": "2018-04-27 20:25:26"}

Staff was very helpful in assisting with selections and knowledgeable on the ingredients. We enjoyed the BBQ chicken with tika masala sauce and really good naan bread. The biryani with chicken was also yummy! Fun to see the food being prepared in the tandoori ovens. Great addition to the fast casual scene in Cleveland.", "date": "2015-01-03 22:47:34"}

There are a few small tables outside but most of the business is carry out. Pierogies Plus wins Best Pierogies every year. Why? Because the owner is from Poland and she is making the real deal pierogies. The best part is that they are hand pinched by a group of older Polish and Hungarian women. \nThe biggest seller is potato and cheese but they sell many flavors. They are like plump pillows of softness. You can buy them buy the dozen. You can get them cold to take home and freeze or warm and ready to eat. The warm ones are served with butter and onions.  It's definitely a comfort food. The best part is that they ship internationally. Yes, they are that good.", "date": "2017-05-13 10:41:43"}

Although it's not exactly a restaurant -- more like a snack bar, limited menu and you walk up to the counter, place your order, wait a minute or so for them to prepare your order, and pay the cashier, then search for a table.  Kind of like a sandwich shop.  Still a much better choice for value than the other hotel Deli's on the strip.", "date": "2016-01-17 05:26:22"}

Once we were all seated, we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour, and when someone did come by, we asked whether we could place our orders, to which he said he could not; he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders. \n\nMAIN: Caprese Salad\n\nThe salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking. I personally did not find this dish filling, so I ordered the sweet potato fries as well (See below).\n\nMAIN: Sweet Potato Fries (this was worth it) \n\nThese fries were actually very delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you visit this restaurant, I would recommend this particular dish, especially given the price ($8) and the portion size (it was quite large - almost the size of a large plate).", "date": "2017-12-29 13:55:19"}

I was with 2 other females...we had on dresses and heels. The place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed. Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn't make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn't because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be \"picky\" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again.", "date": "2014-07-13 16:17:18"}
